# Python Exercises
---
This python exercise is based on the website [Practice Python](https://www.practicepython.org/). I'm doing this exercise to train and help me to better understand python as language. The exercises are broken down to different levels ranging from level 1 to 4 with various difficulties. Completed exercises will be added to the readme

## Level 1 : Exercises

### Exercise 1 : Print Even Number
Print even numbers below 100
### Exercise 2 :Print Odd Number
Print odd numbers below 100
### Exercise 3 : Character Input
Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.
### Exercise 4 : Odd or Even
Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.
### Exercise 5 : List Ends
Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. 
### Exercise 6 : Element Search
Write a function that takes an ordered list of numbers (a list where the elements are in order from smallest to largest) and another number. The function decides whether or not the given number is inside the list
### Exercise 7 : Max of Three
Implement a function that takes as input three variables, and returns the largest of the three. Do this without using the Python max() function!
The goal of this exercise is to think about some internals that Python normally takes care of for us. All you need is some variables and if statements!
### Exercise 8 : Birthday Dictionaries (w/play again feature)
For this exercise, we will keep track of when our friendâ€™s birthdays are, and be able to find that information based on their name. Create a dictionary (in your file) of names and birthdays. When you run your program it should ask the user to enter a name, and return the birthday of that person back to them. The interaction should look something like this:
```
>>> Welcome to the birthday dictionary. We know the birthdays of:
Albert Einstein
Benjamin Franklin
Ada Lovelace
>>> Who's birthday do you want to look up?
Benjamin Franklin
>>> Benjamin Franklin's birthday is 01/17/1706.
```

## Level 2 : Exercises

### Exercise 1 : List Less Than
Write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.
### Exercise 2 : Divisors
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number.
### Exercise 3 : List Overlap
Write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.
### Exercise 4 : String List
Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not.
### Exercise 5 : List Comprehensions
Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.
### Exercise 6 : Fibonacci
Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then generates them.
### Exercise 7 : List Remove Duplicates
Write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates).
### Exercise 8 : Create Hangman Game
Use words from a text file
### Exercise 9 : Birthday JSON and Birthday Months
1) In this exercise, modify your program from Part 1 to load the birthday dictionary from a JSON file on disk, rather than having the dictionary defined in the program.
2)  In this exercise, load that JSON file from disk, extract the months of all the birthdays, and count how many scientists have a birthday in each month.
